By deriving and comparing the generalization error bounds for both standard PINNs and XPINNs, the work reveals a fundamental trade-off in domain decomposition: while decomposing a complex function into simpler ones on subdomains reduces the necessary model complexity (improving generalization), the need to enforce interface conditions introduces an additional learning cost that can harm generalization.

###### [Learning in Sinusoidal Spaces with Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13901)
- **Date:** 2021.09
- **Description:** This paper diagnoses a key failure mode in training PINNs, showing that expressive networks are initialized with a bias towards flat, near-zero functions, trapping them in trivial local minima of the PDE residual loss. To overcome this, it proposes sf-PINN, an architecture that preprocesses inputs with a sinusoidal feature mapping. The authors theoretically prove that this mapping increases input gradient variability at initialization, providing effective gradients for the optimizer to escape these deceptive local minima. This simple, non-intrusive modification is shown to significantly improve the training stability and final accuracy of PINNs.

Instead of minimizing the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the PDE residuals, Delta-PINNs optimize a novel loss function based on the change ("Delta") of the mean of the residuals over training epochs. This approach focuses on driving the expectation of the residuals to zero in a monotonically decreasing fashion, effectively averaging out the effects of noise rather than fitting to it. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness, successfully solving forward and inverse problems even when the training data is corrupted with up to 100% noise.

Building on this, they propose a two-stage MAD-PINN framework, which first uses LAD-PINN to identify and then screen out outliers based on the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), and subsequently trains a standard PINN on the cleaned data for high accuracy. This approach is shown to be effective even when more than 50% of the data is corrupted.

For generative properties, PAL proposes using them to augment a small initial dataset by generating a large number of new, physically-consistent pseudo-data points. This physics-based data augmentation allows neural networks to learn from generative physical laws that are inaccessible to the standard PINN approach.

The work also introduces an unbiased, perturbation-based training objective, resolving a key limitation of the original PFGM, and provides a method to transfer hyperparameters from well-tuned diffusion models. PFGM++ with intermediate `D` values is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on image generation benchmarks.

#### [Calibrating Biophysical Models for Grape Phenology Prediction via Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03898)
- **Date:** 2025.08
- **Description:** It proposes a hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. This method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

#### [HeartUnloadNet: A Weakly-Supervised Cycle-Consistent Graph Network for Predicting Unloaded Cardiac Geometry from Diastolic States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18677)
- **Date:** 2025.07
- **Description:** HeartUnloadNet is a deep learning framework that predicts unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape directly from end-diastolic (ED) meshes while explicitly incorporating biophysical priors. The network accepts meshes of arbitrary size and physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness, and fiber helicity orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It employs a graph attention architecture and a cycle consistency strategy for bidirectional (loaded and unloaded) prediction, enabling partial self-supervision, which improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training datasets.
