- **Description:** This paper introduces the Parareal Physics-Informed Neural Network (PPINN), a framework designed to accelerate the solution of long-time integration problems for time-dependent PDEs. It combines the classical Parareal parallel-in-time algorithm with PINNs. The method uses a computationally cheap "coarse" solver to provide a global approximation, while multiple "fine" PINN solvers work in parallel to correct the solution on short time sub-intervals. This hybrid, iterative approach significantly reduces the wall-clock time for long-time simulations by decomposing a serial problem into parallelizable sub-problems.

###### [When Do Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (XPINNs) Improve Generalization?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09444)
- **Date:** 2021.09
- **Description:** This paper provides the first theoretical generalization analysis for Extended Physics-Informed Neural Networks (XPINNs). By deriving and comparing the generalization error bounds for both standard PINNs and XPINNs, the work reveals a fundamental trade-off in domain decomposition: while decomposing a complex function into simpler ones on subdomains reduces the necessary model complexity (improving generalization), the need to enforce interface conditions introduces an additional learning cost that can harm generalization. The authors conclude that XPINNs outperform PINNs if and only if the gain from the reduced function complexity outweighs the cost of learning the interface constraints.

The network is trained using a physics-informed loss. This architecture is inherently sparse and offers partial interpretability, as the learned basis functions and their weights directly correspond to a classical solution expansion.

Then, this prediction is "projected" onto a manifold representing the feasible solution space defined by physical laws. This two-step process mathematically guarantees that the final output strictly satisfies the imposed physical constraints, addressing a key limitation of soft-constraint methods and enhancing the scientific fidelity of the predictions.

The authors draw a crucial distinction between "discriminative" physical properties (like PDEs, suitable for PIL's loss function) and "generative" properties (like conservation laws, which are hard to enforce as residuals). For generative properties, PAL proposes using them to augment a small initial dataset by generating a large number of new, physically-consistent pseudo-data points. This physics-based data augmentation allows neural networks to learn from generative physical laws that are inaccessible to the standard PINN approach.
