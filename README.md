Key innovations include a generalized-mean loss for unsupervised domain specialization (divide-and-conquer), a differentiable Minimum Description Length (MDL) objective for simplification (Occam's Razor), and a 'theory hub' for unification and lifelong learning.

#### [AI Feynman: A physics-inspired method for symbolic regression](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay2631)
- **Date:** 2020.04
- **Description:** Introduces a novel, physics-inspired algorithm for symbolic regression that recursively discovers symbolic expressions from data. The method uses a neural network to approximate the unknown function and then applies a suite of physics-inspired techniques (e.g., dimensional analysis, symmetry detection, separability) to recursively break the problem down into simpler ones, which are finally solved by a brute-force search. It successfully rediscovered 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics.
- **Domain:** `Symbolic Regression` `AI for Science` `Equation Discovery` `Neural Networks` `Physics-Inspired AI`

#### [AI Feynman 2.0: Pareto-optimal symbolic regression exploiting graph modularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10782)
- **Date:** 2020.06
- **Description:** An improved version of the AI Feynman algorithm introducing three key innovations: (1) seeking a Pareto-optimal frontier of formulas that balance accuracy and complexity, (2) using neural network gradients to discover generalized symmetries and arbitrary graph modularity, and (3) employing Normalizing Flows to extend symbolic regression to probability distributions. The method demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness to noise and solves more complex problems than its predecessor.

#### [Flow Matching for Generative Modeling](http.arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747)
- **Date:** 2023.02
- **Description:** Introduces Flow Matching (FM), a new, simulation-free paradigm for training Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) at scale. The method regresses a vector field that generates a predefined probability path from noise to data. Its core innovation, Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), makes the objective tractable and efficient by leveraging simple per-sample conditional paths. The paper also proposes using Optimal Transport (OT) paths, which are more efficient than standard diffusion paths, leading to faster training, faster sampling, and state-of-the-art performance on large-scale image generation tasks.

- **Date:** 2022.12
- **Description:** Proposes a novel generative modeling paradigm, Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), that does not require a predefined prior noise distribution. It embeds the data manifold into a higher-dimensional space and constructs a vector field, derived from the solution to a classic Poisson PDE, that deterministically transports the data distribution to a uniform distribution on a hemisphere. To generate samples, one simply samples from this uniform distribution and solves the corresponding ODE backward in time. PFGM achieves state-of-the-art likelihood scores with extremely high sampling efficiency.

- **Date:** 2024.04

KANs feature learnable activation functions on the edges (parameterized as splines) instead of fixed activations on the nodes. This fundamental architectural shift results in superior accuracy and better scaling laws on various tasks, including function fitting and PDE solving. Most importantly, their structure is inherently interpretable, making them a promising tool for scientific discovery.

#### [KAN 2.0: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks Meet Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10205)
- **Date:** 2024.08
- **Description:** This work elevates KANs from a neural network architecture to a comprehensive, bidirectional framework for scientific discovery. It establishes a synergy between science and KANs, enabling both the incorporation of scientific knowledge into KANs (via auxiliary variables, modular structures, and a novel "kanpiler" for compiling formulas) and the extraction of scientific insights from them (via feature attribution, a "tree converter" for modularity, and symbolic simplification). The paper also introduces MultKAN, an extension that includes native multiplication nodes, enhancing interpretability and efficiency.

- **Description:** It proposes a hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. This method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

#### [HeartUnloadNet: A Weakly-Supervised Cycle-Consistent Graph Network for Predicting Unloaded Cardiac Geometry from Diastolic States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18677)
- **Date:** 2025.07
- **Description:** HeartUnloadNet is a deep learning framework that predicts unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape directly from end-diastolic (ED) meshes while explicitly incorporating biophysical priors. The network accepts meshes of arbitrary size and physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness, and fiber helicity orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It employs a graph attention architecture and a cycle consistency strategy for bidirectional (loaded and unloaded) prediction, enabling partial self-supervision, which improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training datasets.
