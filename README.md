<!-- ### 1.1 Theoretical Physics -->
## 1. Theoretical Physics

Quantum Mechanics, Gravitation, etc.
#### [SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01939)
- **Date:** 2025.07
- **Description:** A CLIP-inspired foundation model for stellar spectral analysis that leverages cross-instrument contrastive pre-training and spectrum-aware decoders to enable precise spectral alignment, parameter estimation, and anomaly detection across diverse astronomical applications.

<!-- ### 1.2 Experimental Physics -->
## 2. Experimental Physics
#### [ScienceAgentBench: Toward Rigorous Assessment of Language Agents for Data-Driven Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05080)
- **Date:** 2024.10
- **Description:** ScienceAgentBench evaluates LLM agents on 102 validated scientific tasks, showing even top-performing models (32.4-42.2% success rates) remain far from reliable automation, with performance gains requiring prohibitive cost increases. 

#### [SciCode: A Research Coding Benchmark Curated by Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13168):
- **Date:** 2024.04
- **Description:** A scientist-curated benchmark (338 subproblems from 80 research challenges) with coding components.

<!-- ## 2. AI for Physical Application -->

### 3.1 Engineering
  #### [Achieving Precise and Reliable Locomotion with Differentiable Simulation-Based System Identification](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.04696v1)
- **Date:** 2024.10
- **Description:** It combines system identification with RL training to optimize physical parameters from trajectory data, achieving 75% reduction in rotational drift and 46% improvement in directional movement for bipedal locomotion compared to baseline methods.
  
### 3.2 Healthcare and Biophysics
  #### [Calibrating Biophysical Models for Grape Phenology Prediction via Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03898)
- **Date:** 2025.08
- **Description:** It combines system identification with RL training to optimize physical parameters from trajectory data, achieving 75% reduction in rotational drift and 46% improvement in directional movement for bipedal locomotion compared to baseline methods.
  #### [HeartUnloadNet: A Weakly-Supervised Cycle-Consistent Graph Network for Predicting Unloaded Cardiac Geometry from Diastolic States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18677)
- **Date:** 2025.07
- **Description:** HeartUnloadNet is a deep learning framework that predicts unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape directly from end-diastolic (ED) meshes while explicitly incorporating biophysical priors. The network accepts meshes of arbitrary size and physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness, and fiber helicity orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It employs a graph attention architecture and a cycle consistency strategy for bidirectional (loaded and unloaded) prediction, enabling partial self-supervision, which improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training datasets.

#### [SeePhys: Does Seeing Help Thinking? -- Benchmarking Vision-Based Physics Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19099)
- **Date:** 2025.05
- **Description:** It proposes a hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. This method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.
  
#### [PHYSICSEVAL: Inference-Time Techniques to Improve the Reasoning Proficiency of Large Language Models on Physics Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00079)
